# Problem 12 {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Problem

<p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the $7$<sup>th</sup> triangle number would be $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28$. The first ten terms would be:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \dots$$</p>
<p>We can see that $28$ is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>
<p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>

### Julia

```{julia}
include("euler.jl")

triangle(n::Integer) = sum(1:n)

function p12(amount_divisors::Int64 = 10)
    n = 1
    divs = Int64[]
    while true 
        divs = Euler.prime_factors(triangle(n))

        if length(divs) >= amount_divisors
            break
        end

        n += 1
    end

    return "$n has $(length(divs)) divisors: $divs"
end;

p12()
```

```{julia}
using BenchmarkTools;
@benchmark p12()
