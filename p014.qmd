# Problem 14 {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Problem

<p>The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>$n \to n/2$ ($n$ is even)</li>
<li>$n \to 3n + 1$ ($n$ is odd)</li></ul>
<p>Using the rule above and starting with $13$, we generate the following sequence:
$13 \to 40 \to 20 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1.$</p>
<p>It can be seen that this sequence (starting at $13$ and finishing at $1$) contains $10$ terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at $1$.</p>
<p>Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?</p>
<p class="note"><b>NOTE:</b> Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.</p>

    seq = BigInt[]

    s = BigInt(n)

    while s > 1
        push!(seq, s)

        if s % 2 == 0
            s = div(s, 2)
        else
            s = 3*s + 1
        end
    end 

    push!(seq, 1)
    
    return seq
end

```{julia}

    n, max_chain_length = 1, 1

        l = length(c)

        if l > max_chain_length
            n, max_chain_length = i, l
        end
    end

    return "The biggest chain starts in $n and has $max_chain_length"
