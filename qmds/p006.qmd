## Problem

<p> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
$1^2+ 2 ^2+ \dots + 10^2 = 385.$</p>
<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
$(1+ 2+ \dots + 10)^2 = 3025.$</p>
</p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025-385 = 2640.$</p>

</p> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. </p>
