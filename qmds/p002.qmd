## Problem

<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with $1$ and $2$, the first $10$ terms will be:
$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \dots$</p>
<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

### Julia

```{julia}
function p2()
    a, b = 1, 2
    sum = 2
    while true
        current_fibo_term = a + b
        current_fibo_term > 4_000_000 && break
        iseven(current_fibo_term) && (sum += current_fibo_term)
        a, b = b, current_fibo_term
    end
    return sum
end;
p2()
```

```{julia}
using BenchmarkTools;
@benchmark p2()
```
